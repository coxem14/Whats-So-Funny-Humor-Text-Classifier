## Background

## Back-up: Expand on Capstone 1: MoviEDA-Predicting-Box-Office-Revenues
* GitHub: https://github.com/coxem14/MoviEDA-Predicting-Box-Office-Revenues
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
* There are many features I did not explore the first time around because I needed NLP, image processing, or machine learning techniques.
* Additional things to explore:
  > * Improving my model for predicting box office revenues
  > * Try to predict genre by the movie poster (image processing)
  > * Make a model for which actors to hire for biggest revenues
