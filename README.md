# Capstone-2 Proposal

## Motivational vs Demotivational Quotes Generator
* Webscrape inspirational quotes from this database: https://www.successories.com/iquote/authors/most.
* Create a program to generate inspirational quotes
* Webscrape demotivational quotes from this website: https://despair.com/collections/demotivators
* Create a program to generate demotivational quotes
* Text classification motivational vs demotivational quotes
* Explore image processing to see if my model(s) can classify motivational posters from demotivational posters.
* Motivational posters: https://www.successories.com/motivational-posters/1.
* Demotivational posters: https://despair.com/collections/demotivators (same as above)

> * Some reservations I have about this project:
>     * The data set isn't very large (~700 quotes for motivational, ~100 quotes for demotivational)
>     * I doubt a model would be able to classify the types of posters accurately (they are very similar)

## Back-up 1: Humor Classification and Joke Generator
* https://www.kaggle.com/moradnejad/200k-short-texts-for-humor-detection
> * Build model(s) to classify text as humorous or serious
> * Identify different clusters/topics within humorous text
> * Identify different clusters/topics of serious text
> * Create a program to generate jokes
> * Reservation:
>      * Dataset looks pretty clean and only has 2 columns - maybe not complicated enough

## Back-up 2: Expand on Capstone 1: MoviEDA-Predicting-Box-Office-Revenues
* GitHub: https://github.com/coxem14/MoviEDA-Predicting-Box-Office-Revenues
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
* There are many features I did not explore the first time around because I needed NLP, image processing, or machine learning techniques.
* Additional things to explore:
  > * Improving my model for predicting box office revenues
  > * Try to predict genre by the movie poster (image processing)
  > * Make a model for which actors to hire for biggest revenues
